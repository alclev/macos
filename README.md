# MACOS-specific cyber tools

## Overview

This repository houses a collection of cyber-related tools designed exclusively for educational purposes. These tools include a macOS-specific keylogger, a shell script to change the MAC address, and an SSH spoofing tool. It's important to note that these tools are not intended for malicious use but rather for educational exploration and understanding.

### Ethical Use of Cyber Tools

We emphasize the importance of responsible and ethical practices when dealing with cyber-related tools and techniques. It is crucial to use these tools for legitimate and lawful purposes, such as:

- Enhancing cybersecurity awareness: Studying these tools can help individuals and organizations understand potential vulnerabilities and how to defend against them.

- Penetration testing: Ethical hackers and security professionals can use these tools to assess the security of systems and networks with proper authorization and consent.

- Educational purposes: Learning about these tools can help individuals pursue careers in cybersecurity, where ethical hacking and security assessments are essential skills.

### Prerequisites

- A macOS system for keylogger functionality.
- Basic knowledge of macOS and shell scripting.
- A controlled environment for experimentation.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/alclev/macos.git

## Usage

Here's a brief overview of the tools available:

1. **macOS Keylogger**:
   - This tool is designed to demonstrate how keyloggers work and to educate users on potential security vulnerabilities.
   - It should only be used on a system you own or have explicit permission to monitor.
   - Never use it for unauthorized surveillance or malicious purposes.

2. **MAC Address Changer**:
   - This shell script allows you to change your MAC address for legitimate privacy reasons or testing network configurations.
   - Always ensure you have the necessary permissions to change your MAC address.

3. **SSH Spoofing Tool**:
   - This tool is intended for educational purposes only, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in SSH.
   - Never use it to impersonate or intercept SSH connections without proper authorization.
